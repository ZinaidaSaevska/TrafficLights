# Traffic Lights App

This is a simple app that mimics traffic lights. It consists of two screens - in the first screen the car model is entered. 
There is a validation that the model name should be at least 3 symbols long. On the second screen there is the car model and 
the traffic light. The red lights is on for 4 seconds, the orange for 1 and the green for 4 seconds.
The code is covered by UI tests.
